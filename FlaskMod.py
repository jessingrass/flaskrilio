        """Runs the application on a local development server.  If the
        :attr:`debug` flag is set the server will automatically reload
        for code changes and show a debugger in case an exception happened.

        If you want to run the application in debug mode, but disable the
        code execution on the interactive debugger, you can pass
        ``use_evalex=False`` as parameter.  This will keep the debugger's
        traceback screen active, but disable code execution.

        .. admonition:: Keep in Mind

           Flask will suppress any server error with a generic error page
           unless it is in debug mode.  As such to enable just the
           interactive debugger without the code reloading, you have to
           invoke :meth:`run` with ``debug=True`` and ``use_reloader=False``.
           Setting ``use_debugger`` to `True` without being in debug mode
           won't catch any exceptions because there won't be any to
           catch.

        .. versionchanged:: 0.10
           The default port is now picked from the ``SERVER_NAME`` variable.

        :param host: the hostname to listen on. Set this to ``'0.0.0.0'`` to
                     have the server available externally as well. Defaults to
                     ``'127.0.0.1'``.
        :param port: the port of the webserver. Defaults to ``5000`` or the
                     port defined in the ``SERVER_NAME`` config variable if
                     present.
        :param debug: if given, enable or disable debug mode.
                      See :attr:`debug`.
        :param options: the options to be forwarded to the underlying
                        Werkzeug server.  See
                        :func:`werkzeug.serving.run_simple` for more
                        information.
